# SovietPlus

This Mod is a complete Overhaul of the Soviet Union. The aim is to depict the initial struggle of this country to reach a decent level of industrialization,
the devasting initial months of the war and the huge effort to stop the german Army and push it back to Berlin.
The mod should be played with historical focus on.

## Some other changes
(Without any specific order)
Changed the traits af every political advisor
Change some generic portraits
You cannot use absurdly ahistorical advisors
The only tho parties are the Soviet Communist Party and the Socialist Revolutionary Party
Dekabrist, not "Debakrist"
Adedd the two missing Field Marshals in '36


## QA
### Great Purge
The focus is only 15 days short, but it starts a long (~14 months) period where all the major trials and some (random) flavour events occur. Take it at the right time (not too early, not too late)

### Purge officers
You may purge some Field Marshals and Generals or focus on lower level officers. I'm not sure the second is the best choice (even if the purged generals are quite good). Beware that Winter War does not cancel the purge penalties. They may be in effect when Barbarossa happens.

### How do I complete the 2nd Five-Year Plan?
Through Focuses and Decisions. You have two full years to complete the Plan. You don't want to make Comrade Stalin unhappy, do you?

### Why can I send just 2 divisions in Spain?
The Soviet intervention was limited, if you only count people. As a matter of fact, even two divisions are too much. But you have a focus to further support the Republicans

### Where is Zhukov?
He is a low level general in 1936. He will later appear, as long as other generals

### Barbarossa is devasting
Yes, it is. The Red Army has a terrible penalty for the first three months, and the german army could arrive at the gate of Moscow and Leningrad (as historically did). But the Soviet Union has all the resources to revert the tide.

### How can I put Trotsky in charge?
With this mod you can't, sorry.
