# SovietPlus

This Mod is a complete Overhaul of the Soviet Union. The aim is to depict the initial struggle of this country to reach a decent level of industrialization, the critical initial months of the war and the huge effort to stop the german Army and push it back up to Berlin.
The mod should be played with historical focus on.

## Some other changes
(Without any specific order)
* AI finally build decent INF and ARM templates!
* Added a lot of political advisors (most historically purged)
* Changed the traits of vanilla political advisors
* Changed the generic portraits with historical ones
* You cannot use absurdly ahistorical advisors
* The only two parties are the Soviet Communist Party and the Socialist Revolutionary Party
* Fixed some vanilla typos like "Debakrist for "Dekabrist" , "Guerevich" for Gurevich" etc
* Added the two missing Field Marshals in '36
* Added the Fugas Class (minesweeper)
* Fixed the correct order of the Great Trials, and their historical outcomes
* Rokossowsky purged and then rehabilitated
* Finland never give up Karjala without fighting (if AI controlled)
* Revised the jet names (and pics) and added pics for rocket interceptors (BI-1)
* You can relocate industries from more states (if you have the PP)
* FIN goes to war for Karjela when SOV start losing terrain after Barbarossa (5% capitulation)
* SOV AI has no hardocoded block on reasearch by dates but related to stored equipment


## QA
### Great Purge in 15 days??
The focus is only 15 days short, but it just starts a long (~14 months) period where all the major trials and some (random) flavor events occur, with a constant PP spending during all this time. Take it at the right time (not too early, not too late)

### Purge officers
You may purge some Field Marshals and Generals or focus on lower level officers. I'm not sure the second is the best choice (even if the purged generals are quite good). Beware that Winter War does not cancel the purge penalties. They may be in effect when Barbarossa happens.

### How do I complete the 2nd Five-Year Plan?
Through Focuses and Decisions. You have two full years to complete the Plan. You don't want to make Comrade Stalin unhappy, do you?

### Why can I send just 2 divisions in Spain?
The Soviet intervention was limited, if you only count people. As a matter of fact, even two divisions are too much. But you have a focus to further support the Republicans

### Where is Zhukov?
He is a low level general in 1936. He will later appear, as long as other generals

### Barbarossa is devasting
Yes, it is. The Red Army has a terrible penalty for the first three months, and the german army could arrive at the gate of Moscow and Leningrad (as historically did). But the Soviet Union has all the resources to revert the tide.

### How can I put Trotsky in charge?
With this mod you can't, sorry.

### Why Finland doesn't join Axis but starts a new war alone in 1941?
Because joining axis may lead to strange AI behaviors, like moving there 2 hundreds GER division there and depleting the main front..
