 soviet.119.t:0 "Stalin is not happy"
 soviet.119.d:0 "Sometimes when it comes to dealing with the Man of Steel himself, the odd result here and there doesn’t hurt. But in this case, those results were far below his expectations. You are summoned to Stalin’s office (effective immediately), and there the man sits comfortably in his chair, puffing away at his pipe, enormous plumes of smoke obscuring most of his face following your entrance through half-closed eyes. He gestures to the chair on the other side of his desk. Maybe this wasn’t as bad as you had feared.  Oh how very were you indeed. Stalin leaps to his feet and bends over the entire length of the desk until his face is no less than a foot away from yours. His eyes wide with a severely unwelcoming glower. You go to open your mouth, but no sooner have your lips even parted, Stalin tears you to shreds. Beginning with the typical accusations of being a traitor and an agent working against the Motherland, to outright tirades regarding how well you have been treated and why would you go against your home, your family, your leader.  Eventually Stalin manages to calm himself down and seats himself down to top up his pipe. His eyes return to a passive, half closed state as he focuses on the pipe bowl in front of him. After what feels like ages he finally announces that you will not punished too severely, but your family will be placed under very heavy scrutiny and should you fail again, well, you will find out. And with that he points the door, whereupon a guard opens it and ‘helps’ you out. "
 soviet.119.a:0 "Should I be thankful that I am alive?"
